# Students_performance_classification

## Abstract

One of the goals of education is the success of student learning, it’s a very important factor of nations' evolution, our model will predict student performance using ML. 
The problem is that a lot of students get a low mark, and they are in danger of getting fail.
This topic is benefit to all students, for example:  if one of students predict to get Fail on our model so the student can take an action and get the assistance he needs before failing the class.
We will use our model on Python Programming language to analyze some data sets from Harvard University, one of the data sets contains 398 rows and 33 columns, and second one contains 649 rows and 33 columns. we classified students into three categories: 1- poor, 2- Fair, 3- Good. We get a most Students that is on category Fair, and the smallest number of students on category Good.

### 1. Introduction

In 2020, the pandemic Covid-19 affect negatively on Students performance, the classes shift from in campus classes to studying through online meetings. Students’ performance is determined by several factors. For instance, the amount of study time and the current health of the students.
A lot of factors can negatively affect how students perform in all levels of education, and with pandemic there is big changes with learning, study goes from in campus to online meeting, that’s change a student behavior and might be get a lower result before a pandemic, so we will do in our project a new model to help predicting after the pandemic so these students can get the help they need before a student fails a class.
Our project will be a Machine Learning System that is able to predict if a student is on the trajectory to failure by using certain attributes provided by a dataset. We will use it on Python Programming language to analyze data set and classified students into three categories: 1- poor, 2- Fair, 3- Good.
